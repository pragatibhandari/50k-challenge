      <h2>🧠 Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I restarted the challenge on April 17th</strong> instead of 1st April, with new clarity and commitment. I realized it's okay to start again — what matters is not the perfect beginning, but staying true to the mission.</li>
        <li><strong>Done is better than perfect.</strong> I spent less time overthinking and more time taking action. Imperfect steps are better than flawless ideas stuck in my head.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus beats everything.</strong> Every time I limited distractions and committed to a single task, I made real progress. Energy scattered is energy wasted.</li>
        <li><strong>Momentum matters more than detailed plans.</strong> I didn’t have all the answers this week, but by showing up and moving forward each day, I started building real momentum — and that’s priceless.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>📝 Personal Note</h2>
      <p>The first week of the challenge was about setting the foundation. Exciting and a little scary, but I’ve learned that taking imperfect action beats waiting for the perfect plan. Every day feels like planting seeds for the future.</p>
