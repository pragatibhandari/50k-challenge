    <h2>My Story — The Challenges That Define Me</h2>
    <p><strong>🎓 The University Challenge -</strong> show up everyday
    </p> 
    <p>Mission: <strong>Graduate with honors</strong></p>
    <p>
      I believe growth begins where comfort ends. In October 2024, I moved to Vaasa to begin my master's in Automation Engineering, specializing in Robotics, at the University of Vaasa. With one suitcase, limited resources, and a heart full of determination, That’s when I launched what I called the "University Challenge" - a personal commitment to show up every day, study hard, and aim to graduate with honors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began filming 🎥 one-minute daily videos to document the journey every single day, not for validation, but to stay consistent, grounded, and connected to my purpose. 
    </p>
    <p>
      That challenge is now paused for summer. And a new one has begun. 🌞⏸
    </p>
    <p><strong>💰 The €50K Marathon - </strong> my boldest challenge yet</p>
    <p>Mission: <strong>Make €50,000 in 5 months 🤑</strong> </p> <p>No shortcuts. No excuses. Full transparency. I’ve worked on my health 🏃‍♀️, I’m working in my education and now, I’m tackling wealth 💶, the last missing piece of the puzzle. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve come this far with no safety net, no financial cushion, and no fallback plan. Just vision, faith, and relentless effort. This journey is about taking responsibility, letting go of what I can’t control, and giving everything I’ve got to the things I can. 
    </p>
    <p>This journey isn't just about money, it's about purpose, identity, and self-belief. If you're here, thank you for being part of it.</p>
    <p>
      This is my story and <strong>it’s just getting started... 🚀 </strong>
